## Setup<div id='id-setup'/>
The following sections detail how to set up Keybender on your system, as well as any 3rd-party software needed to boost performance. As of current, Keybender has only been tested on Microsoft Windows.

### Minimal Setup (High Latency)<div id='id-setup-min'/>
Running Keybender with the minimal setup allows you to explore Keybender without installing any third-party software, but comes at the cost of having noticeably high  latency. This can make live performance and recording more difficult.
Initialization:
1) On Windows, run the Keybender executable (keybender.exe).
2) Select a port from the dropdown menu on the right hand side of the application.
3) In order to play notes using the keyboard, don't forget to give focus to the Piano Keyboard Display.
